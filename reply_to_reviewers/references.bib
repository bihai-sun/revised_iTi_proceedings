   abstract = {In this paper there is considered the irrotational motion of an infinite fluid when the normal velocity across a plane is specified as a stationary random function of position in the plane, and a solution is obtained in terms of the specified boundary conditions. It is shown that the mean square velocity normal to the plane is equal to the sum of the mean squares of the velocities in the other two orthogonal directions. The asymptotic variations with distance normal to the plane are found for functions representing the important properties of the motion, and, in particular, the energy of the fluctuations is shown to be inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance from the plane. The conditions postulated are shown to correspond closely to the motion outside a free turbulent boundary, and good agreement is found between the predictions of the theory and the available experimental results.},

@article{Townsend1966,
   abstract = {A considerable quantity of observations and measurements exists concerning the phenomenon of intermittency which is connected closely with the entrainment process in free turbulent flows. A number of these are described in the first part of the paper and conclusions are drawn about the shape and motion of the bounding surface that separates turbulent and non-turbulent fluid. The salient features are that indentations of the surface grow and decay cyclically, that each cycle leads to substantial entrainment of ambient fluid into the turbulent region, that the indentations move at a considerable speed relative to the free stream, and that the surface has a comparatively simple form. The growth–decay cycle of the indentations suggests that a critical condition for growth exists, but the pressure field consequent on the convection velocity of the indentations makes for a Helmholtz type of instability that is unlikely to be stabilized by purely viscous behaviour of the turbulent fluid. It is known that the initial response of turbulent fluid to distortion is elastic in character, with incremental Reynolds stress proportional to increment of total strain, and sufficient rigidity could stabilize the bounding surface. A simple flow model–an inviscid stream flowing over an elastic jelly—is examined and the condition for marginal stability is compared with the observed properties of the flow. The model leads to the conclusion that indentations of more than a critical wave-number are stable, and provides reasons for the comparatively simple form of the surface and for the occurrence of indentations in groups of about three. The relative values of entrainment constants in different flows of uniform density do not depend critically on the nature of the entrainment process provided that the main turbulent motion remains geometrically similar, but the correlation between entrainment constant and relative depth of the indentations found by Gartshore (1966) appears as a consequence of the ‘elastic’ control of the growth–decay cycle. Lastly, the properties of the engulfment mechanism are used to show that the entrainment constant for a jet is proportional to the square root of the ratio of ambient density to the average density inside the jet. In contrast, the corresponding result for engulfment controlled by an eddy viscosity is variation as the ratio of the mean of the ambient and inside density to the inside density. Observations of high-speed jets of water in air and air in water give some support to the ‘elastic’ hypothesis.},

@article{Reynolds1972,
   abstract = {The equations describing the statistical features of small amplitude waves in a turbulent shear flow are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. Closure is achieved through a postulated constitutive equation for the alteration of the statistical properties of the turbulence by the organized wave. The theory is applied in an examination of the stability of a hypothetical wake consisting of small-scale turbulence enclosed within a steady uncontorted superlayer. A set of superlayer jump conditions is derived from fundamental considerations, and these are of more general interest. For this hypothetical flow the analysis predicts largescale instabilities and superlayer contortions reminiscent of large-eddy structures observed in real flows. These instabilities therefore offer an explanation of the presence of large-scale organized motions in turbulent free shear flows.},

More recently, the influence of viscosity differences between a turbulent flow and its surroundings has been studied.

The ambient turbulence is generated using a random jet array. Orthogonal cross-sections of the jet subjected to different levels of ambient turbulence intensities and length scales are captured using planar laser-induced fluorescence. The enhanced radial transport of concentration from the jet core towards the interface and the increased scalar fluctuations within the jet caused by the ambient turbulence result in steeper mean and root-mean-square scalar conditional jumps across the TTI layer compared with those of the TNTI, respectively. When compared with the quiescent ambient, the mean effect of background turbulence is to stretch and corrugate the interface surface area as evident from the wider probability density of the interface radial position, the lowered occurrence of zero-curvature surface elements, the greater misalignment between the radial and normal unit vectors of the interface, the increased tortuosity and the increased magnitude of the fractal exponent.},

@article{Kankanwadi2022,
   abstract = { The existence of a turbulent/turbulent interface (TTI) has recently been verified in the far wake of a circular cylinder exposed to free-stream turbulence (Kankanwadi & Buxton, J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 905, 2020, p. A35). This study aims to understand the physics within the TTI. The wake boundary, approximately 40 diameters downstream of a circular cylinder subjected to grid-generated turbulence, was investigated through simultaneous cinematographic, stereoscopic particle image velocimetry and planar laser induced fluorescence experiments. With no grid placed upstream of the cylinder, the behaviour of the resultant interface, our closest approximation to a turbulent/non-turbulent interface, exactly matched what is observed in existing literature. When background turbulence is present, viscous action is no longer the only method by which enstrophy is transported to the background fluid, unlike for turbulent/non-turbulent interfaces. The presence of rotational fluid on both sides of the TTI allows the vorticity stretching term of the enstrophy budget equation to be the dominant actor in this process. The role of viscosity within a TTI is greatly diminished as the vorticity stretching term takes over responsibilities for enstrophy production. The turbulent strain rate normal to the TTI was found to be enhanced in the interfacial region. Decomposing the vorticity stretching term into components aligned with the three principal strain-rate directions, it was found that the term most aligned with the interface-normal direction contributed to the largest share of enstrophy production. This indicates that better ‘organised’ vorticity on the wake side of the interface yields the enstrophy amplification leading to the previously discovered enstrophy jump across the TTI by Kankanwadi & Buxton ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 905, 2020, p. A35). },

Experiments were carried out to measure the conditional flow statistics for a non-isothermal jet, i.e. a cooled jet. These experiments are complementary to previous experiments on an isothermal Re =2000 jet, where, in the present experiments on a non-isothermal jet, the thermal diffusivity is intermediate to the diffusivity of momentum and the diffusivity of mass. The experimental method is a combined laser-induced fluorescence/particle image velocimetry method, where a temperature-sensitive fluorescent dye (rhodamine 6G) is used to measure the instantaneous temperature fluctuations. The results show that the cooled jet can be considered to behave like a self-similar jet without any significant buoyancy effects. The detection of the interface is based on the instantaneous temperature, and provides a reliable means to detect the interface. Conditional flow statistics reveal the superlayer jump in the conditional vorticity and in the temperature. },

   abstract = {We consider the scalar concentration field in the proximity of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface (TNTI) of a round momentum-driven turbulent jet at Re = 10 600. Orthogonal cross sections of the jet are taken at 50 nozzle diameters from the nozzle exit using planar laser-induced fluorescence. The conditional scalar concentration is evaluated along the interface-normal direction, identifying the thickness of the TNTI region as 0.64λ (where λ is the Taylor microscale). Conditioning the scalar concentration within the TNTI revealed higher values of the passive scalar in the vicinity of the boundary elements shaped by large vorticity structures, i.e., isosurface points with low curvature (flat regions), small interface angle, and large radial distance from the jet centerline. In contrast, small vorticity structures near the boundary manifesting with high interface curvature, high interface angle, and small radial distance are associated with lower concentration values. Using the current experimental resolution, we find that high concentrations near the far boundary points persist up to a distance of 0.40λ–0.48λ into the TNTI region, after which boundary points closer to the jet centerline exhibit larger concentration values along the interface-normal direction, similar to the fully turbulent region. The cross correlation analysis showed that in regions characterized by low streamwise momentum, there are positive, albeit small, scalar correlations between the non-turbulent and the TNTI regions. The latter may imply local detrainment of the fluid particles containing the scalar at far radial positions.},

   abstract = { The role of coherent vortices near the turbulent/non-turbulent (T/NT) interface in a turbulent plane jet is analysed by a direct numerical simulation (DNS). The coherent vortices near the jet edge consist of large-scale vortical structures (LSVSs) maintained by the mean shear and intense vorticity structures (IVSs) created by the background fluctuating turbulence field. The radius of the LSVS is equal to the Taylor micro-scale R lsvs ≈ λ , while the radius of the IVS is of the order of the Kolmogorov micro-scale R ivs ∼ η . The LSVSs are responsible for the observed vorticity jump at the T/NT interface, being of the order of the Taylor micro-scale. The coherent vortices in the proximity of the T/NT interface are preferentially aligned with the tangent to the T/NT interface and are responsible for the viscous dissipation of kinetic energy near the T/NT interface and to the characteristic shape of the enstrophy viscous diffusion observed at that location. },

@article{Chen1978,
   abstract = {A fully developed turbulent boundary layer with a zero pressure gradient was explored by using temperature as a passive contaminant in order to study the large-scale structure. The temperature tracer was introduced into the flow field by heating the entire wall to approximately 12°C above the free-stream temperature. The most interesting observation was the existence of a sharp internal temperature front, characterized by a rapid decrease in temperature, that extended throughout the entire boundary layer. In the outer, intermittent region, the internal temperature front was always associated with the upstream side of the turbulent bulges, i.e. the ‘backs’. It extended across the entire logarithmic region and was related to the sharp acceleration associated with the bursting phenomenon near the wall. Conditional averages of the velocities measured with the temperature front revealed that it was associated with an internal shear layer. The results suggest that this shear layer provides a dynamical relationship between the large structures in the outer, intermittent region and the bursting phenomenon near the wall.},

Comparisons are made with a wake that is ‘forced’ by amplifying initial velocity fluctuations. A temperature field T , with constant values of 1.0 and 0 above and below the wake, is transported across the wake as a passive scalar.

@article{Westerweel2009,
   abstract = { Conditionally sampled measurements with particle image velocimetry (PIV) of a turbulent round submerged liquid jet in a laboratory have been taken at Re = 2 × 10 3 between 60 and 100 nozzle diameters from the nozzle in order to investigate the dynamics and transport processes at the continuous and well-defined bounding interface between the turbulent and non-turbulent regions of flow. The jet carries a fluorescent dye measured with planar laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), and the surface discontinuity in the scalar concentration is identified as the fluctuating turbulent jet interface. Thence the mean outward ‘boundary entrainment’ velocity is derived and shown to be a constant fraction (about 0.07) of the the mean jet velocity on the centreline. Profiles of the conditional mean velocity, mean scalar and momentum flux show that at the interface there are clear discontinuities in the mean axial velocity and mean scalar and a tendency towards a singularity in mean vorticity. These actual or asymptotic discontinuities are consistent with the conditional mean momentum and scalar transport equations integrated across the interface. Measurements of the fluxes of turbulent kinetic energy and enstrophy are consistent with computations by Mathew & Basu ( Phys. Fluids , vol. 14, 2002, pp. 2065–2072) in showing that for a jet flow (without forcing) the entrainment process is dominated by small-scale eddying at the highly sheared interface (‘nibbling’), with large-scale engulfing making a small (less than 10%) contribution consistent with concentration measurements showing that the interior of the jet is well mixed. (Turbulent jets differ greatly from the free shear layer in this respect.) To explain the difference between velocity and scalar profiles, their conditional mean gradients are defined in terms of a local eddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity and the momentum and scalar fluxes inside the interface. Since the eddy diffusivity is larger than the eddy viscosity, the scalar profile is flatter inside the interface so that the scalar discontinuity is relatively greater than the mean velocity discontinuity. Theoretical arguments, following Hunt, Eames & Westerweel (in Proc. of the IUTAM Symp. on Computational Physics and New Perspectives in Turbulence , ed. Y. Kaneda, vol. 4, 2008, pp. 331–338, Springer), are proposed for how the vortex sheet develops, how the internal structure of the interface layer relates to the inhomogeneous rotational and irrotational motions on each side and why the dominant entrainment process of jets and wakes differs from that of free shear layers. },
