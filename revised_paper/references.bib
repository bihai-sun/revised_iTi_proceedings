It is found that the mean normal velocity across the interface and the tangential velocity jump scale with the skin-friction velocity    $u_\{\tau \}$   and are approximately    $u_\{\tau \}/10$   and    $u_\{\tau \}$   , respectively. The width of the superlayer is characterised by the local vorticity thickness    $\delta _\{\omega \}$   and scales with the viscous length scale    $\nu /u_\{\tau \}$   . An order of magnitude analysis of the tangential momentum balance within the superlayer suggests that the turbulent motions also scale with inner velocity and length scales    $u_\{\tau \}$   and    $\nu /u_\{\tau \}$   , respectively. The influence of the wall on the dynamics in the superlayer is considered via Townsend’s similarity hypothesis, which can be extended to account for the viscous influence at the turbulent/non-turbulent interface. Similar to a turbulent far-wake the turbulent motions in the superlayer are of the same order as the mean velocity deficit, which lends to a physical explanation for the emergence of the wake profile in the outer part of the boundary layer. },

   abstract = { Time-resolved planar particle image velocimetry was used to analyse the structuring of a turbulent boundary layer into uniform momentum zones (UMZs). The instantaneous peak-detection method employed by Adrian et al.  ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 422, 2000, pp. 1–54) and de Silva et al.  ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 786, 2016, pp. 309–331) is extended to account for temporal coherence of UMZs. The resulting number of zones detected appears to follow a normal distribution at any given instant. However, the extreme cases in which the number of zones is either very high or very low, are shown to be linked with two distinct flow states. A higher than average number of zones is associated with a large-scale    $Q2$   event in the log region which creates increased small-scale activity within that region. Conversely, a low number of zones corresponds to a large-scale    $Q4$   event in the log region and decreased turbulent activity away from the wall. The residence times, within the measurement plane, of zones belonging to the latter scenario are shown to be on average four times larger than those of zones present during higher than average zone structuring states. For both cases, greater residence times are observed for zones of higher momentum that are generally closer to the free stream. },

   abstract = { Time-resolved velocity fields from direct numerical simulations (DNS) are used to investigate the spanwise extent and the time persistence of uniform momentum zones (UMZs) in a zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer (ZPG-TBL) and a self-similar adverse pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer (APG-TBL) at the verge of separation. The instantaneous detection methodology introduced by Adrian et al. [1] is used to detect the UMZs and is extended to take into account the spanwise domain length and the temporal evolution of the UMZs. The Reynolds number based on friction velocity (Re τ ) ranges from 1176 to 1277 for the ZPG-TBL and from 1652 to 1745 for the self-similar APG-TBL within the domain of interest. For both the TBL cases, probability density functions (PDFs) of the number of UMZs are computed as a function of the streamwise extent, spanwise extent and time extent. For the ZPG-TBL, when the streamwise length of the domain is greater than or equal to 3 boundary layer thickness, the probability of finding 4 UMZs becomes almost negligible. For the APG-TBL, even when the streamwise domain length is taken as large as 1.3 boundary layer thickness, the probability of finding 4 UMZs is still significant. The spanwise extent of the UMZs is found to be shorter than their streamwise extent regardless of the pressure gradient in the flow. In the ZPG-TBL flow, the majority of the UMZs have a spanwise extent of the order of one-tenth of a boundary layer thickness while for the APG-TBL, it is found to be on the order of one-hundredth of a boundary layer thickness. In the ZPG-TBL, the probability of finding 2 UMZs that persist over a time period of 2 integral time scale is around 50%. Similarly, for the APG-TBL, the probability of finding 2 UMZs with a time persistence of 0.4 integral time scale is over 50%. In the case of the ZPG-TBL, it is observed that some of the UMZs with higher persistence in time have higher streamwise momentum and are found to be closer to the free-stream in general. This result is consistent with the previous observations by Laskari et al. [2]. In contrast, for the APG-TBL, UMZs with longer time persistence are found closer to the wall with lower streamwise momentum. },

The temperature tracer was introduced into the flow field by heating the entire wall to approximately 12°C above the free-stream temperature. The most interesting observation was the existence of a sharp internal temperature front, characterized by a rapid decrease in temperature, that extended throughout the entire boundary layer. In the outer, intermittent region, the internal temperature front was always associated with the upstream side of the turbulent bulges, i.e. the ‘backs’. It extended across the entire logarithmic region and was related to the sharp acceleration associated with the bursting phenomenon near the wall. Conditional averages of the velocities measured with the temperature front revealed that it was associated with an internal shear layer. The results suggest that this shear layer provides a dynamical relationship between the large structures in the outer, intermittent region and the bursting phenomenon near the wall.},

   abstract = { Conditionally sampled measurements with particle image velocimetry (PIV) of a turbulent round submerged liquid jet in a laboratory have been taken at Re = 2 × 10 3 between 60 and 100 nozzle diameters from the nozzle in order to investigate the dynamics and transport processes at the continuous and well-defined bounding interface between the turbulent and non-turbulent regions of flow. The jet carries a fluorescent dye measured with planar laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), and the surface discontinuity in the scalar concentration is identified as the fluctuating turbulent jet interface. Thence the mean outward ‘boundary entrainment’ velocity is derived and shown to be a constant fraction (about 0.07) of the the mean jet velocity on the centreline. Profiles of the conditional mean velocity, mean scalar and momentum flux show that at the interface there are clear discontinuities in the mean axial velocity and mean scalar and a tendency towards a singularity in mean vorticity. These actual or asymptotic discontinuities are consistent with the conditional mean momentum and scalar transport equations integrated across the interface. Measurements of the fluxes of turbulent kinetic energy and enstrophy are consistent with computations by Mathew \& Basu ( Phys. Fluids , vol. 14, 2002, pp. 2065–2072) in showing that for a jet flow (without forcing) the entrainment process is dominated by small-scale eddying at the highly sheared interface (‘nibbling’), with large-scale engulfing making a small (less than 10%) contribution consistent with concentration measurements showing that the interior of the jet is well mixed. (Turbulent jets differ greatly from the free shear layer in this respect.) To explain the difference between velocity and scalar profiles, their conditional mean gradients are defined in terms of a local eddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity and the momentum and scalar fluxes inside the interface. Since the eddy diffusivity is larger than the eddy viscosity, the scalar profile is flatter inside the interface so that the scalar discontinuity is relatively greater than the mean velocity discontinuity. Theoretical arguments, following Hunt, Eames & Westerweel (in Proc. of the IUTAM Symp. on Computational Physics and New Perspectives in Turbulence , ed. Y. Kaneda, vol. 4, 2008, pp. 331–338, Springer), are proposed for how the vortex sheet develops, how the internal structure of the interface layer relates to the inhomogeneous rotational and irrotational motions on each side and why the dominant entrainment process of jets and wakes differs from that of free shear layers. },

   abstract = { The behaviour of the velocity and pressure fluctuations in the outer layers of wall-bounded turbulent flows is analysed by comparing a new simulation of the zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer with older simulations of channels. The 99 % boundary-layer thickness is used as a reasonable analogue of the channel half-width, but the two flows are found to be too different for the analogy to be complete. In agreement with previous results, it is found that the fluctuations of the transverse velocities and of the pressure are stronger in the boundary layer, and this is traced to the pressure fluctuations induced in the outer intermittent layer by the differences between the potential and rotational flow regions. The same effect is also shown to be responsible for the stronger wake component of the mean velocity profile in external flows, whose increased energy production is the ultimate reason for the stronger fluctuations. Contrary to some previous results by our group, and by others, the streamwise velocity fluctuations are also found to be higher in boundary layers, although the effect is weaker. Within the limitations of the non-parallel nature of the boundary layer, the wall-parallel scales of all the fluctuations are similar in both the flows, suggesting that the scale-selection mechanism resides just below the intermittent region, y /δ = 0.3–0.5. This is also the location of the largest differences in the intensities, although the limited Reynolds number of the boundary-layer simulation (  Re θ  ≈ 2000) prevents firm conclusions on the scaling of this location. The statistics of the new boundary layer are available from http://torroja.dmt.upm.es/ftp/blayers/ . },

   abstract = {New experimental research is presented on the characteristics of interfaces and internal shear layers that are present in a turbulent boundary layer (TBL). The turbulent/non-turbulent (T/NT) interface at the outer boundary of the TBL shows the presence of a finite jump in streamwise velocity and is characterised by a thin shear layer. It appears that similar layers of high shear occur also within the TBL which separate regions of almost uniform momentum. It turns out that they exhibit similar characteristics as the external T/NT interface. Furthermore, the spatial growth rate of the TBL, that is derived from theoretical analysis, can be correctly predicted from a momentum balance near the external T/NT interface. Similarly, the entrainment velocities for the average internal layers have been determined. Results indicate that internal layers move slower in the vicinity of the wall, whereas they move faster than the large scale boundary layer growth rate in the outer region of the TBL. It is believed that shear layers bound large scale flow regions of approximately uniform momentum. Hence, the entrainment velocities of these internal layers may be interpreted as growth rates of the large scale motions in a TBL.},

   abstract = {One-point statistics are presented for new direct simulations of the zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer in the range Reθ = 2780–6680, matching channels and pipes at δ+ ≈ 1000–2000. For tripped boundary layers, it is found that the eddy-turnover length is a better criterion than the Reynolds number for the recovery of the largest flow scales after an artificial inflow. Beyond that limit, the integral parameters, mean velocities, Reynolds stresses, and pressure fluctuations of the new simulations agree very well with the available numerical and experimental data, but show clear differences with internal flows when expressed in wall units at the same wall distance and Reynolds number. Those differences are largest in the outer layer, independent of the Reynolds number, and apply to the three velocity components. The logarithmic increase with the Reynolds number of the maximum of the streamwise velocity and pressure fluctuations is confirmed to apply to experimental and numerical internal and external flows. The new simulations also extend to a wider range of Reynolds numbers, and to more than a decade in wall distance, the evidence for logarithmic intensity profiles of the spanwise velocity and of the pressure intensities. Streamwise velocity fluctuations appear to require higher Reynolds numbers to develop a clear logarithmic profile, but it is argued that the comparison of the available near-wall data with fluctuation profiles experimentally obtained by other groups at higher Reynolds numbers can only be explained by assuming the existence of a mesolayer for the fluctuations. The statistics of the new simulation are available in our website.},

   abstract = {Two-point statistics are presented for a new direct simulation of the zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer in the range Reθ = 2780–6680, and compared with channels in the same range of Reynolds numbers, δ+ ≈ 1000–2000. Three-dimensional spatial correlations are investigated in very long domains to educe the average structure of the velocity and pressure fluctuations. The streamwise velocity component is found to be coherent over longer distances in channels than in boundary layers, especially in the direction of the flow. For weakly correlated structures, the maximum streamwise length is $\cal\{O\}(7\delta )$O(7δ) for boundary layers and $\cal\{O\}(18\delta )$O(18δ) for channels, attained at the logarithmic and outer regions, respectively. The corresponding lengths for the spanwise and wall-normal velocities and for the pressure are shorter, $\cal\{O\}(\delta$O(δ-2δ). The correlations are shown to be inclined to the wall at angles that depend on the distance from the wall, on the variable being considered, and on the correlation level used to define them. All these features change little between the two types of flows. Most the above features are also approximately independent of the Reynolds number, except for the pressure, and for the streamwise velocity structures in the channel. Further insight into the flow is provided by correlations conditioned on the intensity of the perturbations at the reference point, or on their sign. The statistics of the new simulation are available in our website.},

   abstract = {Instantaneous velocity fields in the x-y plane of a zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer are measured using particle image velocimetry. It is found that there exist random, time-varying zones in the u-ν fields in which the streamwise momentum is remarkably uniform. The largest dimension of a typical zone is proportional to the boundary layer thickness. The zone closest to the wall contains viscous-inertial inclined structures similar to those found in low Reynolds number wall turbulence. A second zone is located above the wall zone in a region that coincides roughly with the logarithmic layer. The wake region of the boundary layer contains a complicated, time-varying pattern of several nearly-constant-momentum zones. The zones are separated from each other and from the free stream by thin viscous shear layers that contain concentrations of spanwise vorticity.},
